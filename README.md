## Project Description:
- Using CDC survey data from 2000 to 2020 of 400,000 adults. 
- We intend to collect and analyze the data to build machine learning models to understand which characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, etc.) to predict heart disease risk factors. 
- Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and PostgreSQL to visualize mortality predictions.
- Determine if there are high risk populations geographically 

## Questions to ask:
- What health factors will have a higher chance of heart disease?
- Do smokers have a higher risk of having heart disease?
- What age category is more expected?
- Which feature(s) in our dataset impact the possibility of heart disease?


## Parameters to consider:
- heart_disease 
- bmi
- smoking
- alcohol consumption
- history of stroke
- physical health
- mental health
- gender
- age
- race
- diabetic
- physical activity
- general health
- hours of sleep
- asthma
- kidney disease
- skin cancer

## Scope of Work:
- Research data sources
- Create a front-end interface to JSON or csv file to “smarten” the algorithm. 
- Perform a deep dive with existing data using machine learning. 
- To predict mortality rates from data available - Predicting and diagnosing illnesses
- Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML (use Leaflet or - Plotly to change the visualization).
- Identify population areas that have the highest mortality rates - Developing stronger prevention strategies.
- Create an idea using mock data and simulate how machine learning might be used.
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
- Initial GitHub repository and set-up of Google slides.
